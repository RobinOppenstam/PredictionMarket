# PredictMarket

A decentralized prediction market platform where users can bet on real-world events using blockchain technology and Chainlink oracles.

## What is PredictMarket?

PredictMarket is a trustless betting platform that allows users to speculate on future outcomes of various events. Using smart contracts on Ethereum, the platform ensures transparent, automated, and fair resolution of markets based on real-world data from Chainlink price feeds.

## Key Features

### üéØ Multiple Market Types
- **Daily Over/Under Markets**: Bet on whether Bitcoin will end the day higher or lower than the opening price
- **Price Race Markets**: Predict which asset will reach a target price first (e.g., Gold vs ETH to $5,000)

### üí∞ Simple Token System
- **pUSD**: The betting currency used across all markets
- **Token Faucet**: Get $10,000 pUSD every 24 hours to start betting
- All bets and winnings are denominated in pUSD

### üîÆ Powered by Chainlink Oracles
- Real-time price data from trusted Chainlink price feeds
- Automated market resolution based on oracle data
- Support for BTC/USD, ETH/USD, Gold/USD, and more

### üìä Dynamic Odds & Pool-Based Betting
- Odds adjust in real-time based on how much is bet on each outcome
- The more people bet on one side, the lower the potential payout
- Winners share the losing pool proportionally to their bet size

### üèÜ Fair & Transparent
- All logic executed on-chain via smart contracts
- 2% protocol fee on winnings
- Claim your winnings instantly after market resolution
