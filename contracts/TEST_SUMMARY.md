These tests verify the original prediction market functionality still works:

1. ✅ `testCreateMarket` - Creates a RACE market with correct parameters
2. ✅ `testPlaceBet` - Users can place bets on RACE markets
3. ✅ `testMultipleBets` - Multiple users can bet on different outcomes
4. ✅ `testGetMarketOdds` - Calculate correct odds based on pool sizes
5. ✅ `testResolveMarketGoldWins` - Resolves correctly when Outcome A wins
6. ✅ `testClaimWinnings` - Winners can claim their payouts
7. ✅ `testCannotBetAfterEnd` - Prevents betting after market deadline
8. ✅ `testCannotResolveBeforeEnd` - Prevents early resolution
9. ✅ `testCannotClaimBeforeResolution` - Must resolve before claiming
10. ✅ `testSetProtocolFee` - Owner can update protocol fee
11. ✅ `testCannotSetExcessiveFee` - Prevents fees above 10%

### Daily Over/Under Market Tests (18 tests)

#### Market Creation Tests
1. ✅ `testCreateDailyOverUnder` - Creates daily market with correct structure
   - Name: "Daily Bitcoin Over/Under"
   - Outcomes: "Over" vs "Under"
   - Market type: DAILY_OVER_UNDER
   - Captures current price as creation price
   - Sets correct end time

2. ✅ `testAutomationServiceCanCreateDailyMarket` - Automation service has permission
   - Market is marked as `isAutomatic = true`

3. ✅ `testUnauthorizedCannotCreateDailyMarket` - Prevents unauthorized creation
   - Only owner or automation service can create daily markets

4. ✅ `testSetAutomationService` - Owner can set automation service address
   - New automation service can immediately create markets

5. ✅ `testDailyMarketCannotCreateWithPastEndTime` - Validates end time
   - Rejects markets with end time in the past

6. ✅ `testDailyMarketRequiresValidOracle` - Validates oracle address
   - Rejects zero address for oracle

7. ✅ `testDailyMarketCapturesCurrentPrice` - Records starting price
   - Creation price equals current oracle price
   - Target price equals creation price

#### Betting Tests
8. ✅ `testDailyMarketBetting` - Users can bet on Over/Under
   - User1 bets Over (2 ETH)
   - User2 bets Under (3 ETH)
   - Pools updated correctly

#### Resolution Tests
9. ✅ `testDailyMarketResolutionOverWins` - Over wins when price increases
   - Starting: $95,000
   - Closing: $96,000
   - Result: Over wins ✓

10. ✅ `testDailyMarketResolutionUnderWins` - Under wins when price decreases
    - Starting: $95,000
    - Closing: $94,000
    - Result: Under wins ✓

11. ✅ `testDailyMarketResolutionUnderWinsOnEqual` - Under wins on equal price
    - Starting: $95,000
    - Closing: $95,000 (same)
    - Result: Under wins ✓ (because "Over" requires > creation price)

12. ✅ `testCannotResolveDailyMarketBeforeEndTime` - Enforces midnight resolution
    - Daily markets can ONLY resolve at/after end time
    - Prevents manipulation

#### Claiming Tests
13. ✅ `testDailyMarketClaimWinningsOverWon` - Correct payout when Over wins
    - User1 bet: 2 ETH on Over
    - User2 bet: 3 ETH on Under
    - Over wins
    - User1 payout: ~4.94 ETH (2 + 2.94 profit after 2% fee)

14. ✅ `testDailyMarketClaimWinningsUnderWon` - Correct payout when Under wins
    - User1 bet: 2 ETH on Over
    - User2 bet: 3 ETH on Under
    - Under wins
    - User2 payout: ~4.96 ETH (3 + 1.96 profit after 2% fee)

15. ✅ `testLoserCannotClaimWinnings` - Losers cannot claim
    - Reverts with "Not a winning bet"

#### Integration Tests
16. ✅ `testMultipleDailyMarkets` - Multiple daily markets can coexist
    - Creates 2 daily markets with different end times
    - Total: 3 markets (1 RACE + 2 DAILY)

17. ✅ `testRaceMarketStillWorks` - Backwards compatibility verified
    - Original RACE market (ID 0) still functions correctly
    - Betting, resolution, and claiming work
    - Market type correctly set to RACE

## Key Test Scenarios Covered

### ✅ Access Control
- Owner can create all market types
- Automation service can create daily markets
- Regular users cannot create daily markets
- Owner can set automation service address

### ✅ Market Creation
- Creates with correct names and outcomes
- Captures current oracle price
- Validates oracle address
- Validates end time
- Marks automatic vs manual markets

### ✅ Resolution Logic
- Over wins when closing > starting
- Under wins when closing < starting
- Under wins when closing = starting
- Cannot resolve before end time (daily markets)
- Cannot resolve before deadline (race markets)

### ✅ Payout Calculations
- Parimutuel betting math is correct
- 2% protocol fee is applied correctly
- Winners get original bet + share of losing pool
- Losers cannot claim

### ✅ Market Coexistence
- RACE and DAILY markets work side-by-side
- Multiple daily markets can exist
- Each market type has correct resolution logic

### ✅ Edge Cases
- Zero address oracle rejected
- Past end time rejected
- Equal price scenario handled correctly
- Unauthorized users blocked

## Test Utilities Used

- **vm.prank()** - Simulate transactions from different addresses
- **vm.warp()** - Fast-forward time for testing deadlines
- **vm.expectRevert()** - Verify error conditions
- **assertEq()** - Verify exact values
- **assertGt()** - Verify greater than
- **assertApproxEqAbs()** - Verify approximate equality (for payouts with fees)

## Gas Usage

Average gas costs for daily market operations:
- Create daily market: ~300,794 gas
- Place bet: ~98,217 gas
- Resolve market: ~454,767 gas
- Claim winnings: ~451,067 gas
